:pencil2:  **About me:**

    What motivates me the most is to be able to understand a problem and solve it through the information collected.
    Accountant with an analytical, organized, detail-oriented profile, proactive, team player and with ability to work 
    under pressure and deadlines.
    I have extensive experience in multinational companies in different industries such as oil and pharmaceuticals, 
    performing accounting, controlling and analysis tasks.
    Furthermore, I have experience in ETL and creating reports and dashboards to follow up and monitor significant KPI's.
    In recent years I have been focusing my profile more towards data analysis, learning through courses and bootcamps.
    Those trainings have given me more skills in data analysis and visualization, allowing me to collect reliable 
    information and provide meaningful insights to the stakeholders.
